A simple **Tic Tac Toe** game implemented in Java, designed using **Object-Oriented Principles** as typically required in LLD machine coding interviews.

This project simulates a two-player CLI-based Tic Tac Toe game and demonstrates clean code, modularity, and maintainability.

## ðŸ§± Features

- Two human players (X and O)
- 3x3 board
- Detects win and draw conditions
- Handles invalid moves (out-of-bounds or already occupied)
- Clean OOP structure (SOLID-ish design)

## ðŸ§ª Sample Gameplay

```
Satvik's turn. Enter row and column (0-2): 
0 0

Aditya's turn. Enter row and column (0-2): 
1 1

Satvik's turn. Enter row and column (0-2): 
0 1

Aditya's turn. Enter row and column (0-2): 
2 2

Satvik's turn. Enter row and column (0-2): 
0 2

Satvik wins! ðŸŽ‰
